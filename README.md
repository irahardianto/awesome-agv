<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

**The setup** provides a comprehensive sets of standards and practices designed to elevate the capabilities of AI coding agents. It provides a suite of strict rules distilled from software engineering best practices that ensure generated code is secure, defensible, and maintainable. It also provides specialized skills that will help throughout software development.

Instead of just generating code that works, the rules and skills ensures agents generate code that **survives**.

While this configuration is originally designed for **Antigravity**, it is built on standard markdown-based context protocols that are easily portable to other AI coding tools. As a matter of fact, the original form [Technical Constitution](https://github.com/irahardianto/technical-constitution/blob/main/technical-constitution-full.md) was first created for **Gemini CLI**

You can drop this configuration into the context or custom rule settings of:

*   **Roo Code**
*   **Claude Code**
*   Any other agentic tool that supports custom system prompts or context loading.

For example, the principles of the [Rugged Software Constitution](.agent/rules/rugged-software-constitution.md) which is based on [Rugged Software Manifesto](https://ruggedsoftware.org/) are universal and will improve the output of any LLM-based coding assistant.

### Key Features

*   📏 **30 Rules** — covering security, reliability, architecture, maintainability, and DevOps.
*   🛠️ **7 Skills** — specialized capabilities for debugging, design, code review, and more.
*   🔄 **10 Workflows** — end-to-end development processes from research to ship.
*   🏗️ **Two-Tier Rule System** — always-on mandates + contextual principles for zero-noise enforcement.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To equip your AI agent with these superpowers, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

*   An AI Coding Assistant (Antigravity, Roo Code, Cline, etc.)
*   A project where you want to enforce high standards.

### Installation

**Quick Install (recommended):**
```sh
npx awesome-agv
```

This downloads and installs the latest `.agent/` directory into your current project. Your AI agent will automatically pick it up — no additional configuration needed.

**Options:**

| Flag           | Description                                    |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `[target-dir]` | Directory to install into (default: `./`)      |
| `--force, -f`  | Overwrite existing `.agent/` without prompting |
| `--help, -h`   | Show help                                      |

### Examples

```bash
# Install into current directory
npx awesome-agv

# Install into a specific project
npx awesome-agv ./my-project

# Overwrite existing installation without prompting
npx awesome-agv --force
```

**Manual Install:**

1.  Clone this repository or copy the `.agent` folder into the root of your project.
    ```sh
    cp -r /path/to/awesome-agv/.agent ./your-project-root/
    ```
2.  Ensure your AI agent is configured to read from the `.agent` directory (most of well-known AI coding assistant are adhering to the `.agent` convention by default, no action needed) or manually ingest the `.agent/rules/**` as part of its system prompt.

<!-- USAGE -->
## Usage

Once installed, the rules and skills in this repository become active for your agent.

### Rule Architecture

The setup uses a **two-tier rule system** to minimize noise while maximizing coverage:

| Type           | Trigger          | Purpose                                                                                                                      |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Mandates**   | `always_on`      | Non-negotiable constraints loaded in every session (security, logging, code completion).                                     |
| **Principles** | `model_decision` | Contextual guidance activated only when working on relevant areas (e.g., database rules activate only when writing queries). |

Conflicts between rules are resolved by [Rule Priority](.agent/rules/rule-priority.md) — security always wins.

### Development Workflows

The setup includes opinionated, end-to-end workflows that chain rules and skills into structured development processes.

#### 🏭 Feature Workflow (`/orchestrator`)

The primary workflow for building features. Phases execute sequentially — **no skipping**.

```
Research → Implement (TDD) → Integrate → E2E (conditional) → Verify → Ship
```

| Phase        | Workflow                                          | Purpose                                                                                                                 |

| 5. Ship      | [`/5-commit`](.agent/workflows/5-commit.md)       | Git commit with conventional format                                                                                     |

#### 🔧 Specialized Workflows

| Workflow                                      | When to Use                                          |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| [`/quick-fix`](.agent/workflows/quick-fix.md) | Bug fixes with known root cause (<50 lines)          |
| [`/refactor`](.agent/workflows/refactor.md)   | Safely restructure code while preserving behavior    |

| **Single backend**      | Remove frontend rules/workflows, keep backend paths              |
| **Single frontend**     | Remove backend rules/workflows, keep frontend paths              |
| **Microservices**       | Adapt `project-structure.md` per service, add service mesh rules |
| **Mobile (Flutter/RN)** | Adapt frontend rules, add mobile-specific accessibility/testing  |

**To adapt:** Edit `project-structure.md` and `4-verify.md` to match your project layout.
