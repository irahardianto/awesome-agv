## What Are Workflows?

Workflows are structured, multi-phase development processes defined in `.agent/workflows/`. They chain rules and skills together into repeatable, quality-enforced development cycles.

Each workflow is invoked as a **slash command** (e.g., `/orchestrator`, `/quick-fix`) and guides the agent through specific phases with completion criteria at each step.

### Choosing the Right Workflow

| Situation | Workflow |
|-----------|----------|
| Building a new feature | `/orchestrator` |
| Fixing a known bug (<50 lines) | `/quick-fix` |
| Restructuring code | `/refactor` |
| Reviewing code quality | `/audit` |
| Running a single phase | `/1-research`, `/2-implement`, etc. |

---

## 🏭 Feature Workflow (`/orchestrator`)

**File:** `.agent/workflows/orchestrator.md`

The primary workflow for building features. Treats the development lifecycle as a **state machine** — no phase can be skipped.

### Flow

```
Research → Implement (TDD) → Integrate → E2E (conditional) → Verify → Ship
```

### Phases

| Phase | Gate | Output |
|-------|------|--------|
| Research | Research log created | `task.md` + `docs/research_logs/*.md` |
| Implement | Unit tests pass | Production code + unit tests |
| Integrate | Integration tests pass | Integration tests (Testcontainers) |
| E2E (conditional) | E2E tests pass + screenshots | E2E tests + screenshots |
| Verify | All linters pass | Coverage report |
| Ship | Committed | Git commit |

### Key Rules
- **FORBIDDEN from skipping phases** — each phase must complete before the next starts
- Agent acts as a "Senior Principal Engineer with a mandate for strict protocol adherence"
- Pre-implementation: scan `.agent/rules/`, identify applicable rules, READ them
- Tasks marked `[x]` only after Phase 4 (Verify) passes


### Error Handling
If a phase fails:
1. Document the failure in task summary
2. Do not proceed to next phase
3. Fix the issue within current phase
4. Re-run phase completion criteria
5. Then proceed

---

## Phase 1: Research (`/1-research`)

**File:** `.agent/workflows/1-research.md`

Understand the request context and gather knowledge before writing any code.

### Steps
1. **Analyze Request** — parse requirements, identify scope
2. **Review Current Implementation** — understand existing architecture
3. **Build Mental Model** — requirements, constraints, integration points
4. **Define Scope** — create `task.md` with atomic tasks
5. **Identify Research Topics** — list all technologies involved
6. **Search Documentation** — use Qurio or web search for each topic
7. **Document Findings** — create `docs/research_logs/{feature}.md`
8. **Document Architecture Decisions** — create ADRs using ADR Skill if needed
9. **Fallback** — web search if documentation search fails

### Skills Used
- **Sequential Thinking** — for complex design decisions
- **ADR** — for significant architecture decisions

---

## Phase 2: Implement (`/2-implement`)

**File:** `.agent/workflows/2-implement.md`

Write production code following Test-Driven Development (TDD).

### TDD Cycle
1. **Red** — write a failing test
2. **Green** — write minimal code to make it pass
3. **Refactor** — improve structure while keeping tests green

### Unit Test Requirements
- Mock all dependencies (interfaces)
- Test happy path, error paths, AND edge cases
- Target >85% coverage on domain logic

### Skills Used
- **Sequential Thinking** — for complex refactoring
- **Debugging Protocol** — for non-obvious test failures
- **Guardrails** — pre-flight checklist before writing code

---

## Phase 3: Integrate (`/3-integrate`)

**File:** `.agent/workflows/3-integrate.md`

Test adapter implementations with real infrastructure using Testcontainers.

### When Required
- Code that touches database (storage implementations)
- Code that calls external APIs
- Code that uses message queues, caches, etc.

### Steps
1. Setup Testcontainers (PostgreSQL, Redis, NSQ, etc.)
2. Write integration tests (`*_integration_test.go` or `*.integration.spec.ts`)
3. Run integration tests
4. Optional manual verification

---

## Phase 3.5: E2E Test (`/e2e-test`)

**File:** `.agent/workflows/e2e-test.md`

Validate complete user journeys through the full system using Playwright MCP.

### When Required
- UI components were added or modified
- API endpoints interact with frontend
- Critical user-facing flows were changed

### When to Skip
- Pure backend/infrastructure changes
- Internal library refactoring
- Test-only changes

### Steps
1. Start services (docker compose or local dev)
2. Create E2E test plan
3. Execute with Playwright MCP (navigate, interact, screenshot)
4. Document results with screenshots in `docs/e2e-screenshots/`

---

## Phase 4: Verify (`/4-verify`)

**File:** `.agent/workflows/4-verify.md`

Run all linters, static analysis, and tests to ensure code quality.

### Backend Validation (Go)
```bash
gofumpt -l -e -w . && go vet ./... && staticcheck ./... && gosec -quiet ./... && go test -race ./...
```

### Frontend Validation (TypeScript/Vue)
```bash
pnpm run lint --fix && npx vue-tsc --noEmit && pnpm run test
```

### Build Check
```bash
# Backend
go build ./...

# Frontend
pnpm run build
```

### Coverage Target
>85% on domain logic.

### If This Phase Fails
1. Do NOT proceed to Ship
2. Fix the issue (go back to Phase 2 or 3)
3. Re-run full verification
4. Only proceed when ALL checks pass

---

## Phase 5: Ship (`/5-commit`)

**File:** `.agent/workflows/5-commit.md`

Commit completed work with proper conventional commit format.

### Conventional Commit Format
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

### Types
| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `feat` | New feature |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `refactor` | Code change (no new feature/fix) |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests |
| `chore` | Maintenance, dependencies |
| `perf` | Performance improvement |
| `ci` | CI/CD configuration changes |

---

## 🔧 Quick-Fix Workflow (`/quick-fix`)

**File:** `.agent/workflows/quick-fix.md`

Fast-track bug fixes and small changes (<50 lines) that don't require full research or integration phases.

### When to Use
- Bug fixes with a known root cause
- Small, isolated changes
- Hotfixes for production issues
- Addressing review findings from `/audit`

### Phases
1. **Diagnose** — identify the bug, locate affected code, optionally use Debugging Protocol skill
2. **Fix + Test (TDD)** — write failing test, apply fix, verify existing tests pass
3. **Verify + Ship** — full validation suite, commit with `fix` type

---

## 🔧 Refactor Workflow (`/refactor`)

**File:** `.agent/workflows/refactor.md`

Safely restructure existing code while preserving behavior.

### When to Use
- Code restructuring (moving, renaming, splitting modules)
- Pattern migration (e.g., callbacks → async/await)
- Dependency upgrades with breaking changes
- Addressing tech debt or architectural improvements

### Requires a Specific Goal
- ✅ `/refactor extract storage interface in task feature`
- ✅ `/refactor split user handler into separate auth handler`
- ❌ `/refactor apps/backend` (too vague — use `/audit` first)

### Phases
1. **Impact Analysis** — map blast radius, document existing behavior, identify risks
2. **Incremental Change (TDD)** — one change at a time, tests pass at each step
3. **Parity Verification** — full validation, compare coverage (equal or better)
4. **Ship** — commit with `refactor` type

### Key Principle
Never break the build for more than one step at a time.

---

## 🔧 Audit Workflow (`/audit`)

**File:** `.agent/workflows/audit.md`

Inspect existing code quality without writing new features. Produces structured findings for subsequent fix workflows.

### When to Use
- After another agent's feature is committed (cross-agent review)
- Periodic quality gates
- Before releases or deployments
- Verification without new code

### Phases

1. **Code Review** — invoke the Code Review Skill against specified files
2. **Automated Verification** — full lint/test/build validation
3. **Findings Report** — saved to `docs/audits/review-findings-{feature}-{date}.md`

### Findings Triage

| Finding Type | Example | Follow-Up |
|-------------|---------|-----------|
| Nit / minor | "Rename `x` to `userCount`" | Fix directly |
| Small isolated fix | "Add input validation" | `/quick-fix` in new conversation |
| Structural change | "Storage not behind interface" | `/refactor` in new conversation |
| Missing capability | "No auth on admin routes" | `/orchestrator` in new conversation |

### Best Practice
Run audits in a **fresh conversation** (not the one that wrote the code) to avoid confirmation bias.
