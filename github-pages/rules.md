## How Rules Work

Rules are markdown files in `.agents/rules/` that provide guidance to AI agents. Each rule has a **trigger type** in its YAML frontmatter:

| Trigger          | Behavior                                                              |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `always_on`      | Loaded in every session — non-negotiable constraints                  |
| `model_decision` | Activated contextually when the agent determines the rule is relevant |

When rules conflict, [Rule Priority](https://github.com/irahardianto/awesome-agv/blob/main/.agents/rules/rule-priority.md) determines the winner. Security always wins.

## 🕸️ Rule Dependency Graph

The rules are highly interconnected. You can explore these relationships using our **[Interactive Rule Dependency Graph](rule_dependency_graph.html)** to see how individual mandates, principles, and idioms relate to each other.

## 🛡️ Security & Integrity

Rules that ensure code is secure by default.

### Rugged Software Constitution

### Security Mandate
{: .d-inline-block }
always_on
{: .label .label-red }

**File:** `security-mandate.md`

Non-negotiable security requirements:

### Rule Priority
{: .d-inline-block }
always_on
{: .label .label-red }

2. Rugged Software Constitution
3. Code Completion Mandate
4. Testability-First Design
5. Feature-specific principles
6. PRD-gated principles (feature flags, GitOps)
7. YAGNI / KISS
